This area was roughly the\noriginal confines of the village of St. Louis. Due to the area\u2019s age, there\nwere many historic buildings torn down. It may seem strange to some as to why\nthe city of St. Louis would agree to let the National Park service destroy\ntheir historic city but there is important context surrounding the situation.\nDespite the Gateway Arch being built during the 1960s, planning for it began\nduring the Great Depression in the 1930s. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\nwanted to create a monument to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s westward expansion. More\nimportantly, building this monument would create jobs as part of his New Deal\npolicies.</p>\n\n<p>To accomplish the goal of building\na monument, the federal government estimated that it would cost $30 million. The\nbill would be split: $7.5 million would come from the city of St. Louis and the\nremainder would come from the federal government. As a result, the city of St. Louis\nheld a vote on a bond issue to raise the $7.5 million in 1935. The vote on the\nbond issue was an overwhelming 2.5 to 1 approval. (\u201cRiver Front Bond Issue Approved\u201d).\nThe extremely high approval raised some concerns and there were calls to\ninvestigate the election for fraud but the Public Works Administration who\ncarried out the election was never obligated to and chose not to investigate. (\u201cPWA\nDenies Inquiry.\u201d).</p>\n\n<p>Despite the possible voter fraud,\nthe project continued but quickly ran into other hurdles. Several landowners sued\nthe federal government asking for more money in exchange for their land. This\nprocess took several years and was delayed even further by the United States\u2019\ninvolvement in World War II. Eventually the war ended, and the cases were\nsettled allowing for the demolition of the 37 blocks to commence.</p>\n\n<p>There is some speculation that the\nproject was only meant to clear the \u201cblighted\u201d property on the riverfront and\nraise property values of surrounding land. Despite being less romantic than\ncreating a monument to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Luisiana Purchase, clearing the land\nappears to have been successful. Much of downtown St. Louis surrounding the\nArch comprises of large venues or office buildings; no longer are the streets\nlined with cast iron and brick facades.</p><br><p></p><p><strong>Works Cited</strong><br></p><p>\u201cRiver Front Bond Issue Approved By 2 1-2 To 1 Vote.\u201d <em>St.\nLouis Post-Dispatch,</em> 11 September 1935, p. 4.
