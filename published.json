This area was\nroughly the original confines of the village of St. Louis. Due to the area\u2019s\nage, there were many historic buildings torn down. It may seem strange to some\nas to why the city of St. Louis would agree to let the National Park service\ndestroy their historic city but there is important context surrounding the\nsituation. Despite the Gateway Arch being built during the 1960s, planning for\nit began during the Great Depression in the 1930s. President Franklin Delano\nRoosevelt wanted to create a monument to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s westward expansion.\nMore importantly, building this monument would create jobs as part of his New\nDeal policies.</p>\n\n<p>To accomplish the goal of building\na monument, the federal government estimated that it would cost $30 million. The\nbill would be split: $7.5 million would come from the city of St. Louis and the\nremainder would come from the federal government. As a result, the city of St. Louis\nheld a vote on a bond issue to raise the $7.5 million in 1935. The vote on the\nbond issue was an overwhelming 2.5 to 1 approval. (<a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/139987171/\" target=\"\" rel=\"\">https://www.newspapers.com/image/139987171/</a>).\nThe extremely high approval raised some concerns and there were calls to\ninvestigate the election for fraud but the Public Works Administration who\ncarried out the election was never obligated to and chose not to investigate. (<a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/138949402/\" target=\"\" rel=\"\">https://www.newspapers.com/image/138949402/</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Despite the possible voter fraud,\nthe project continued but quickly ran into other hurdles. Several landowners sued\nthe federal government asking for more money in exchange for their land. This\nprocess took several years and was delayed even further by the United States\u2019\ninvolvement in World War II. Eventually the war ended, and the cases were\nsettled allowing for the demolition of the 37 blocks to commence.</p>\n\n<span>There is some speculation that the project was only\nmeant to clear the \u201cblighted\u201d property on the riverfront and raise property\nvalues of surrounding land. Despite being less romantic than creating a\nmonument to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Luisiana Purchase, clearing the land appears to\nhave been successful. Much of downtown St. Louis surrounding the Arch comprises\nof large venues or office buildings; no longer are the streets lined with cast\niron and brick facades.</span><br>"}, "type": "overview"}, {"date": "", "location": {"lat": -48.92249926375823, "line": true, "lon": -18.45703125, "zoom": 3}, "media": {"caption": "", "credit": "", "url": ""}, "text": {"headline": "Valentine Warehouse Co.", "text": "Housed&nbsp;<span>C&amp;H Sugar Co.</span>"}}, {"date": "", "location": {"lat": -44.465151013519616, "line": true, "lon": -24.08203125, "zoom": 3}, "media": {"caption": "", "credit": "", "url": ""}, "text": {"headline": "Mangelsdorf Seed Co.", "text": "<a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/138951526/\">https://www.newspapers.com/image/138951526/</a>"}}, {"date": "", "location": {"lat": -10.660607953624762, "line": true, "lon": -48.33984375, "zoom": 3}, "media": {"caption": "", "credit": "", "url": ""}, "text": {"headline": "Moser Paper Box Co.", "text": "moved to 4500 block of euclid ave<br><a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/573371838/?match=1&amp;terms=demolition%20riverfront\" title=\"Link: https://www.newspapers.com/image/573371838/?match=1&amp;terms=demolition%20riverfront\">https://www.newspapers.com/image/573371838/?match=1&amp;terms=demolition%20riverfront</a>"}}, {"date": "", "location": {"lat": 26.588527147308614, "line": true, "lon": -12.83203125, "zoom": 3}, "media": {"caption": "November 1, 1940, looking west on Chestnut Street from Wharf Street.
